                    <p>
                        I bridge the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, taking an active role on both sides and defining how the application looks as well as how it works. With extensive experience in interactive design &amp; front-end development at agencies, startups, and large corporations, I bring a unique and valuable perspective &amp; skill set to every project.
